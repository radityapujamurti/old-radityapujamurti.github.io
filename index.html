        <h2>Skola</h2><p><em> - Meteor, Blaze, MongoDB, Heroku</em></p>
        <br>
        <p> This is a side project that I have been working for about 2 months. The main idea here is to create a platform that connects those who are looking for scholarship information and those who know any scholarship information. Ultimately, this application aims to be a community for scholarship seekers and providers. The spark for me to start this project was when I lost my scholarship a few months ago. It made me realize how valuable a scholarship is and we should not take it for granted.<br>
        In this project, I explore the awesomeness of <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a> even further. If you have not tried Meteor, I strongly suggest you do so (you will notice in this site I praise Meteor a lot - because it is super cool!). What makes Meteor really great is the presence of ever growing list of useful packages. In this project, one of the most useful packages is Meteor Toys. With the package, you can monitor the state of your database, Session variables. This is really useful as you can not only see but also update the content of the database. As a result, you can easily e.g. toggle true/false a variable in your MongoDB to test how your Blaze function reacts with the change.

        <h2>Finance Web Application</h2><p><em> - .Net MVC, Kendo UI, SQL, VB, Visual Studio</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Ongoing internship project at <a href="http://www.optimai.com/" target="_blank">Optimai</a>, really challenging my limit! I learnt a lot (I mean really a lot! More than all things I learnt
            from my modules in NUS. I strongly recommend you guys to go for internship!) and what excites me the most is all 
          new tools that we can use. One of them is <a href="http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui" target="_blank">Kendo UI</a> : it is versatile and super handy! You can export a grid to excel file just by configuring the component with one line of code! But be careful though, configuring the user interface (UI) component to suit your context may be tricky (and sometimes can be frustrating) <br>
          Another tool that I found really useful was <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/" target="_blank">Amcharts</a>. It is rich with cool features and highly customizable. I have tried other similar tool such as <a href="http://www.flotcharts.org/" target="_blank">Flot</a>, but this one is more suitable for my project. It has great documentation and will surely satisfy most of your chart needs.

        <h2>First Hackathon!</h2><p><em> - MeteorJS, Java Script, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</em></p>
        <br> 
        <p>It is extremely exciting to code and fight the urge to sleep at the same time! The theme for this hackathon is about to fight corruption, be it in government bodies or even our daily lives. Together with 4 other friends of mine, we built a web app that allows users to post photos regarding problems they face in their region. The hope is for the government to respond to these problems and eventually make the world a better place for everyone (at least for the users).
        <br>
        Going to the technical side of this project, we used <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">MeteorJS</a>. To put it simply, it allows you to built rich and real-time web application quickly! For instance, creating a login feature can be done just with a single line of code (assuming you have installed the required package). Strongly recommend MeteorJS to anyone who needs to build web application fast!

        <h2>Software + Hardware, Awesome!</h2><p><em> - Arduino, Raspberry Pi, C</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>The rite of passage for all computer engineering students - CG3002! This modules challenges us both in software and hardware realm. The aim is to build a wearable device for visually impaired users. When obstacles detected from the sensors, the device will alert the users and suggest the best course of action to stay on track. <br>
        Going to the geeky side, we utilized <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> as the main 'brain' as it has relatively more powerful processing power. For input/output (I/O), on the other hand, <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardMega">Arduino Mega</a> is our top pick as it has more ports to be connected to our sensors. There are tons of projects that harness the goodness of these devices that you can find online. You should get your hands on these too! They are relatively affordable and easy to use.  </p>

        <h2>First (Hybrid) Mobile App!</h2><p><em> - Javascript, Appery.io, MongoDB</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>This is not the main project my summer internship, but rather self-initiatiated one. I was really curious in how to build mobile app and found this great tool to help me: <a href="https://appery.io/" target="_blank">Appery.io</a>. It is amazingly easy to use, the only drag-and-drop online app builder out there (drop me a comment on 'contact' below if there is another similar tool). It would be appealing to both beginners and intermediate programmers as we can open the full source code for customization. The best part is, it is free! Even though the free version only allows us to create three views, in my opinion that is more than enough to get you hands dirty in building your own great app! Oh, did I mention you will get MongoDB as a database for your app as well?  </p>

        <h2>First Desktop App!</h2><p><em> - Java, Eclipse</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>In this module, we are given a task to create a to-do manager for desktop. The main challenge is that users should only use keyboard for input. No mouse! This is rather different from what we usually encounter in many apps today. After building this app, we realize how powerful it is to use only keyboard because every time you reach your mouse, it takes a split second and accumulatively, distract the flow of your app usage. That's why iDO++ is simple.powerful.fast! <br>
        <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> is the integrated development environment (IDE) for this project. It is powerful and I personally like the drag and drop UI builder. It is similar to the one you have in Microsoft's Visual Studio where you can edit the properties of particular elements such as color, onclick events, etc. </p>

        <h2>First Web Application Project!</h2><p><em> - Google App Engine, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Part of the NUS School of Computing's <a href="http://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Orbital</a> summer program. I strongly recommend my NUS juniors to participate in this project. Apart from getting 4 modular credits, you will be exposed to various state-of-the-art tools, especially in web development. <br> This is the first time I got my hands dirty: trying to figure out how the web works and played around with basic HTML and CSS. This is also the time when I first met <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">bootstrap</a>, a super handy tool to kickstart your web project. For this project, my team consists of 2 people: my partner and I aimed to build a web application that can help our friends in NUS who want to find a place to study (finding an empty table in NUS can be challenging especially near exam time). Ideally we need to get access to security cameras and update the images on the web app live. But that was when we learnt about security and confidentiality. Not easy but we definetely learnt a lot! </p>

    <h2><a href="blog/Azure-Cloud-Service-vs-Virtual-Machine/index.html">Azure Cloud Service vs Virtual Machine</a></h2>
    <p>Initially it might be confusing to deal with Azure's cloud service and virtual machine. When I search for explanation online, most of the answers I found were mostly too technical. Here I would like to share with you the difference between the two after working with them, as simply as possible! Please note that this is how I perceive the two services and it might not be 100% accurate.</p>

    <h2><a href="blog/Quickly-Fix-CSS-From-Your-Browser/index.html">Quickly Fix CSS from Your Browser</a></h2>
    <p>Configuring the CSS often can be tricky, especially when we take over project from someone else. Generally, we should know how CSS works in affecting how each element is rendered. There might be more than one CSS rule applied to the same element and you may ask, which rule affects the element? As a rule of thumb, CSS rule that is placed last is the one that affects the element, as the name suggests (cascading).</p>

    <p>Firstly, calm down. It can be recovered. I believe you have tried to search for solutions online but still unable to get the right solution. You have tried to restart the VM, reset access, resize the VM, etc. But the problem persists. Believe me, I have been there too. I was unable to access to the virtual machine after configuring some cipher. If you did the same, most likely the solution below will be helpful to you. Take a deep breath, I know how stressful it feels. So these are the steps that you can try.</p>

    <p>If you are required to enhance or 'harden' the security of your network, there are several things you can configure. We may not realize the importance of setting the security properly until something wrong happens. Like the famouse adage says, prevention is better than a cure. Please note that these things are not exhaustive. There may be more things you need to set but these are the things that I did in my project.</p>

Or maybe you have seen these things somewhere but they are not obvious enough for beginners like us. So here is the things that I miss when I first started my Meteor project.</p>

    <h2><a href="blog/Create-Free-Personal-Website-With-Github/index.html">Create Free Personal Website with Github</a></h2>
    <p>Recently I went for several interviews to get my first internship. One interesting observation that I had was most of the interviewers asked me for 'personal website/online portfolio'. At that time my expectation was that I only need to bring my hard copy CV or resume and I will be good to go, right? No. Apparently it is the trend now (or perhaps it is just me who were not aware) where your interviewer ask about your personal projects, online portfolio or personal website. If you think about it, online portfolio has many more advantages than the traditional (boring) printed CV. It is more dynamic, more personalized, you can insert photos, videos, sample codes. Not mentioning it is more environmentally friendly. More importantly, you can write articles to share your experience or knowledge about things that you learnt. In other words, you can help others who are facing similar difficulties. Awesome!</p>
