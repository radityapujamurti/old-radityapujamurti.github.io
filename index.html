  <h3>ABOUT THIS PAGE</h3>
  <p><em>The future is online!</em></p>
  <p>I usually don't post my activities online but there is nothing wrong in trying something new! This page focuses more on my programming projects and I will share with you some useful tools that may help you in your own projects as well. The content may not be substantial but hey, everyone has to start somewhere, right? As usual, on the top right hand of your screen, you can navigate by clicking one of those options. Don't worry, the navigation bar will follow you wherever you go so no fear my friend. Happy reading! </p>

        <h2>Finance Web Application</h2><p><em> - .Net MVC, Kendo UI, SQL, VB, Visual Studio</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Ongoing internship project at <a href="http://www.optimai.com/" target="_blank">Optimai</a>, really challenging my limit! I learnt a lot (I mean really a lot! More than all things I learnt
            from my modules in NUS. I strongly recommend you guys to go for internship!) and what excites me the most is all 
          new tools that we can use. One of them is Kendo UI : it is versatile and super handy! You can export a grid to excel file just by configuring the component with one line of code! But be careful though, configuring the user interface (UI) component to suit your context may be tricky (and sometimes can be frustrating) <br>
          Another tool that I found really useful was <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/" target="_blank">Amcharts</a>. It is rich with cool features and highly customizable. I have tried other similar tool such as Flot, but this one is more suitable for my project. It has great documentation and will surely satisfy most of your chart needs.

        <h2>First Hackathon!</h2><p><em> - MeteorJS, Java Script, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</em></p>
        <br> 
        <p>It is extremely exciting to code and fight the urge to sleep at the same time! The theme for this hackathon is about to fight corruption, be it in government bodies or even our daily lives. Together with 4 other friends of mine, we built a web app that allows users to post photos regarding problems they face in their region. The hope is for the government to respond to these problems and eventually make the world a better place for everyone (at least for the users).
        <br>
        Going to the technical side of this project, we used MeteorJS. To put it simply, it allows you to built rich and real-time web application quickly! For instance, creating a login feature can be done just with a single line of code (assuming you have installed the required package). Strongly recommend MeteorJS to anyone who needs to build web application fast!

        <h2>First (Hybrid) Mobile App!</h2><p><em> - Javascript, Appery.io, MongoDB</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>This is not the main project my summer internship, but rather self-initiatiated one. I was really curious in how to build mobile app and found this great tool to help me: <a href="https://appery.io/" target="_blank">Appery.io</a>. It is amazingly easy to use, the only drag-and-drop online app builder out there (drop me a comment on 'contact' below if there is another similar tool). It would be appealing to both beginners and intermediate programmers as we can open the full source code for customization. The best part is, it is free! Even though the free version only allows us to create three views, in my opinion that is more than enough to get you hands dirty in building your own great app! Oh, did I mention you will get MongoDB as a database for your app as well?  </p>

        <h2>First Web Application Project!</h2><p><em> - Google App Engine, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Part of the NUS School of Computing's Orbital summer program. I strongly recommend my NUS friends and juniors to participate in this project. Apart from getting 4 modular credits, you will be exposed to various state-of-the-art tools, especially in web development. <br> This is also the first time I got my hands dirty: trying to figure out how the web works and played around with basic HTML and CSS. My partner and I aimed to build the web app so as to help our friends in NUS who want to find a place to study (finding an empty table in NUS can be challenging especially near exam time). Ideally we need to get access to security cameras and update the images on the web app live. But that was when we learnt about security and confidentiality. Not easy but we definetely learnt a lot! </p>
