  <h1>Create Free Personal Website with Github Page</h1>
  <p> Recently I went for several interviews to get my first internship. One interesting observation that I had was most of the interviewers asked for 'personal website/online portfolio'. At that time my expectation was that I only need to bring my hard copy CV or resume and I will be good to go, right? No. Apparently it is the trend now (or perhaps it is just me who were not aware) where your interviewer ask about your personal projects, online portfolio or personal website. If you think about it, online portfolio has many more advantages than the traditional (boring) printed CV. It is more dynamic, more personalized, you can insert photos, videos, sample codes. Not mentioning it is more environmentally friendly. More importantly, you can write articles to share your experience or knowledge about things that you learnt. In other words, you can help others who are facing similar difficulties. Awesome! <br><br> So I discovered that we can easily create our portfolio on Github. The best part is it is very easy to set up and maintained. And it is completely free! I strongly recommend my friends to try it, even to those who never learn coding before. So these are the steps you can take to create your own masterpiece!  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      The first step you need is to get a text editor. This text editor will allow you to open the required files such as .html, .css and .js files. You can use any text editor that you like. I would recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> if you have no preference. They are easy to use and have the ability to auto-complete hence you type less and accomplish more!
    </li>
    <li> Follow the awesome guide from Github <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please click the link now. No worry, I can wait here until you finish.</li>
    <li> After you created your hello world page, you want to start thinking about the design of your portfolio. You can search online for free templates. One of my favourites is from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_me.asp" target="_blank">W3School</a>. In fact the design that I use currently is from the awesome website!</li>
    <li>Add content to your portfolio. Here you need to learn the basic of HTML, CSS and (a little bit) of Javascript. You can easily find many tutorials online to learn about these languanges. Again, I like to go to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3School</a> to learn various syntax of these versatile trio (why versatile? You can build a fully functional web application just by knowing these 3 languanges).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    There you go, you can create a personal website easily and with Git, it is completely free!
