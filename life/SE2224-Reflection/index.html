    This module has changed the way I look at art and Balinese art in particular. Now I can appreciate the music, the dance and the whole meaning behind why some people are really passionate about art.  <br><br>
    
    Since young I was not particularly interested in any form of traditional Balinese art. Even though my mother and sister were Balinese dancers, I don’t inherit their talent for dancing. I remember the time when my mother brought me to a Balinese dance performance and I ended up running away from the show. From that moment I think my mother gave up trying to expose me to other forms of Balinese art. I was simply not interested. <br><br>

    Interestingly, things started to change after I spend several years in Singapore. Maybe partly because when people ask me whether I can dance when I say I am from Bali, my answer would be no. Shame. Initially I didn’t bother. After a while I start to feel something is not right about this. <br><br>

    Then in semester 7 in NUS I finally took this module and it opened my eyes. I started to see and appreciate the beauty of Balinese art, especially dance. That dance is not merely about the movements. That dance is way of life. That dance teaches you discipline. That dance is a sacred knowledge.  <br><br>

    It even makes me rethink life in general. Initially I don’t see the point on why some people choose to pursue arts as their passion. Science is the one that produces goods and services, which make our life better. So we should do science, not art. Naïve. Perhaps we, human, are not meant to do mundane, repetitive jobs. Those are for robots. They can do much better work than us. Maybe we are designed for activities that require more creativity such as art. I feel excited after dancing. I feel more energized. I feel more alive. Maybe art is the one that makes us more human. Maybe. <br><br>
    
    All in all, this module helped me to reinvent my identity as a Balinese. I am thankful and extremely proud of the rich culture that we have. I am also particularly excited, for the current trend where more and more jobs are replaced by robots. Some people see increasing unemployment. Maybe true. But what I see is a future where we do not have to do those repetitive and meaningless jobs. I see more opportunity for us to do what makes us human, which is art.<br><br>
