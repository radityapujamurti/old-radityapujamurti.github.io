    This module has changed the way I look at art and Balinese dance in particular. Now I can appreciate the music, the movement and the whole meaning behind why some people are really passionate about art.  <br><br>
    
    Since young I was not particularly interested in any form of traditional Balinese art. Even though my mother and sister were Balinese dancers, I don’t inherit their talent for dancing. I remember the time when my mother brought me to a Balinese dance performance and I ended up running away from the show. From that moment I think my mother gave up trying to expose me to other forms of Balinese art. I was simply not interested. <br><br>

    Interestingly, things started to change after I spend several years in Singapore. Maybe partly because when people ask me whether I can do Balinese dance, my answer would be no. Shame on me! Haha. Initially I didn’t bother. After a while I started to feel something is not right about this. Then in semester 7 in NUS I finally took this module and it opened my eyes. I started to see and appreciate the beauty of Balinese art, especially the dance. Dance is not merely about the movements. It teaches us discipline, hardwork and respect to our teachers. <br><br>
     Before taking this module, I did not understand why some people choose to pursue arts as their passion. Now I have better understanding. Arts promotes imagination and creativity. I feel more excited after dancing. I feel more energized. I feel more alive. I believe that we are not meant to do mundane, repetitive jobs. We are not robots. Maybe art is the one that makes us more human. <br><br>

    All in all, this module helped me to reinvent my identity as a Balinese. I am thankful and extremely proud of the rich culture that we have. If you are interested to experience what I am trying to describe here, take this module! Please note that the one week trip to Bali during the recess week is <strong>compulsory</strong>. To me, it was the trip that makes this module different from other modules that I took. The best way to experience the Balinese culture is to really go there and talk to the people and learn from them! Have fun :)  <br><br>
