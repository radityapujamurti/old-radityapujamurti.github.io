      <h2>SMA Bali Mandara Sharing</h2> <p><em>October 2018</em></p>
      <p>
        It has been a while, finally I had the opportunity to visit SMA (high school) Bali Mandara. It is always a joy to share some tips on how to search for scholarship information, what factors need to be considered when studying overseas, as well as exposing career opportunities in Singapore. The students in this school really appreciate what they have and that is the main reason why I kept coming back to this school!

    <h2>SEA Hackathon 2018</h2> <p><em>August 2018</em></p>
    <p>
      It has been a while since I joined my first hackathon few years ago. With more knowledge that I have so far, I tried to build something that may be useful for company's employees well being. The topic for this year's SEA hackathon revolved around 'productivity' and 'mental health'. After discussing with my team, we decided to build a device that can signal when you are busy so that other people will not disturb you (unless it is reaaally urgent!) for a specific time e.g. 25 minutes. As a result, we managed to build a mini device that can detect whether you are on your desk and you can change your status to 'busy' with a click of a (hardware and virtual) button. It is using Raspberry Pi as its brain and some LEDs as indicators. We also created a web dashboard with Node.js + Vue.js where you can see other people's status and click the virtual button. Even though we did not win any prize, it was a fun and rewarding experience!

      Facebook has served me well in past few years but it becomes less and less relevant in my daily life. The Cambridge Analytica data leak scandal is the tipping point why I decided to deactivate my account. <a href="https://medium.com/@radityapujamurti/why-i-deactivated-my-facebook-account-7747be6b4267">Read more</a>

      <h2>Life at <a href="http://www.seagroup.com">SEA</a> | Big Day Out</h2>
      <em>December 2017</em><br>
      Work hard, play harder! Every year all of us, sailors, will gather to play and have fun as one big family. This event further illustrates how SEA always strives to maintain the sailors' well being. In this one-full-day-packed-with-action event, we could forget about work and just enjoy the SEA (yes, I have waited for some time to use this pun :p). There were arcade games, free-flow snacks stalls and buffet lunch, of course. Oh, did I mention about the lucky draw? You could win Go-Pro action camera, latest Huawei phone and the ultimate prize, a trip to Maldives for two! I did not get any but I will definitely try again next year.

      <h2>Life at <a href="http://www.seagroup.com">SEA</a> | Arena of Valor (AOV) Competition</h2>
      <em>November 2017</em><br>
      There is something special about this month's birthday celebration: AOV competition. I have been playing this game for about 1 month and I am now addicted to it. I used to play similar games on PC like League of Legends and DOTA but this one is simpler (and less tiring). Despite that, it requires similar strategy: whether to split push, stick together for a team fight, etc. My team only aimed for consolation prize but we managed to clinch the first runner-up. Well done, team!

      <h2>Life at <a href="http://www.seagroup.com">SEA</a> | Birthday Celebration</h2>
      <em>October 2017</em><br>
      In SEA, there is high emphasis on the Sailors' (the staff in SEA) welfare. One of the event to illustrate this is birthday celebration. Sailors from the same department will gather and celebrate with food, games and other fun activities. I believe it is important to take a break from our work, stop to smell the roses and eat some birthday cakes :)

      <h2>NUS Journey | A Reflection</h2>
      So what did you learn from the past 4 years in NUS? Any advice for your juniors? I will try to answer these questions while reflecting on my NUS journey at the same time. Please do not take my views as the gospel of truth. They are just my opinions and some of you might find them useful. I will try to avoid general stuff such as ‘get out of your comfort zone’ or ‘be proactive’ and be as specific as possible. <a href="NUS-Reflection/">Read more</a>

      <h2>STT Nusa Putra Trip</h2>
      On 3rd - 5th June, Denny and I visited STT Nusa Putra in Sukabumi, West Java, Indonesia. We were invited as guest speakers for the international seminar organized by the civil engineering student union in the campus. Since day 1, the host treated us especially well: a hotel room was booked to ensure we have ample rest before the seminar. This is a huge surprise for me as I expected we would be staying in the student dormitory. Transportation is all also settled for us. Whenever we needed to go somewhere, the organizer have prepared a car to navigate the district. <a href="STT-Nusa-Putra-Visit/">Read more</a>

      <h2>PPIS Aid to Geranting</h2>
      PPI (Indonesian Student Union) Singapura organised social trip to Geranting island on 21st-22nd May 2016. I really love the people there: they do not hesitate to greet foreigners like us. In this trip, we taught the children how to make arts and craft with used plastic bottles. We hope that they can turn used plastic into something more useful in the future. Some of us painted the school wall on the second day while the rest were busy building foundation for water container. One of the main difficulties there is access to clean water. Sometimes the villagers have to travel to the neighbouring islands just to get drinkable water. It makes us understand how water that we take for granted in Singapore is scarce commodity in the island.

      Together with PINUS (Indonesian Student Union in NUS) Social division 2016/2017, we embarked on a social mission to help the orphanage in Vistos Kasih, Batam. In this one day trip, the volunteers conducted station games to kick start the event. While taking a break in between the games, they share their experience in Singapore to the orphans. I was in charge in the kitchen where we cook Balinese style ayam sambal bawang for lunch. Even though the trip was short but it was certainly a meaningful one.
