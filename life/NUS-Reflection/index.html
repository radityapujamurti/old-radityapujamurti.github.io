    So what did you learn from the past 4 years in NUS? Any advice for your juniors? I will try to answer these questions while reflecting on my NUS journey at the same time. Please do not take my views as the gospel of truth. They are just my opinions and some of you might find them useful. I will try to avoid general stuff such as ‘get out of your comfort zone’ or ‘be proactive’ and be as specific as possible. <br><br> 
    <h2>1.  Know more people (especially in your major)</h2>
    I put it as the top of the list as I would not be able to survive NUS without the help from my friends. The main reason is because I was involved in many external projects outside the modules I took. I had to juggle between studies and other commitments and I think all NUS students do. <br><br>
    Missing lectures, tutorials, and assignments are inevitable (sometimes missing lectures are not but we believe it is inevitable, especially the morning ones.) I would ask my friends from the same major to help me with the notes and tutorial answers. <br><br>
    However, when I have fewer commitments, I tried to catch up and help my friends in need too. We need balance. It is unfair that we are the only one asking for help and expect your friends to always assist us.  <br><br>
    The lesson learned here is that in life we will struggle. Knowing the right people at the right time will tremendously help us. Building a genuine relationship will also hone our interpersonal skill which is a very valuable aspect moving forward. <br><br>
    <h2>2.  Get internship</h2>
    The longer the internship, the better. Try to get the 6 months internship as more companies will be willing to accept us. If possible try to aim for start-up companies or small-medium enterprise (SME). Overseas internship such as NUS Overseas College (NOC) is even better!<br><br>
    I personally felt I learned the most during my internship, both in hard and soft skills.  In addition, the experience we get will help us in finding the right job in the future (for those who took HR2002, it is the ‘career with heart’ chapter). <br><br>
    Through internship, we will have much better understanding about a particular job or industry. It may be suitable or not suitable for us, depending on our experience. If it suits us, great! Even if it does not, at least we know that we do not want to work in that particular sector in the future. <br><br>
    Also, we can add to our resume all the achievements or projects that we have done. This will significantly increase the chance of us securing that coveted job after graduation!<br><br>
    <h2>3.  Start your own side-project</h2>
    Having a side project allows us to differentiate ourselves from our peers. We all do the same or similar modules throughout our university life. When companies look at our resume or CV, they may ask ‘why should we hire you and not the next person waiting outside for the interview’? <br><br>
    Here a side project comes to a rescue. It can be about anything that we are passionate about. Since it is something that we are deeply interested in, side project is usually very fun too! <br><br>
    Moreover, the common difficulty that we face is that in order to get a job, usually we need to have a job experience. But how do we get the first job? Here a personal project can help us. There are many online courses that we can learn from such as Coursera and Udacity. We can even collaborate with our friends and propose our inventive ideas to start our own company!   <br><br> <hr>
    In summary, life in NUS has taught me many lessons. It is not about the mathematical formula or engineering practices, but the ability to learn new skills and how to juggle many commitments while fulfilling your duty as a student. Moving forward, the challenges will be more difficult. We will be working adults and have even more commitments in our life. It seems daunting but I am excited for it!<br><br>
